# Inspiration 
Whenever a student needs to consult some higher authority of the college, due to some reason, student need to wait a lot of time in front of their office without having any knowledge about how long they need to wait. Even they are not sure whether they can meet on the same day. Due to this something students have to miss their classes. Hence lots of time is wasted.  

# Solution 
To overcome this problem we are creating an application which provide the information of the availability of a particular authority to whome a student wants to meet and student can also apply for the appointment and an authority can schedule their appointment according to their availability and make a proper timing schedule to meet with the awaiting student through Web application. 
Also, the concerned authority can have a count of how many students they need to address. This applicatin is also implemented on Android devices for the ease of access. 

# Workflow 
*	Both Student and Authority can log in to Web/Android application. 
*	Student can see the availability of the authorities. 
*	Student can register an appointment with authority. 
*	Sign Up option for new student is also provided. 
*	If authority is not available then they can post a comment visible to student regarding that. 
*	Common Notice Portal is also available.
